Hi there!

My name is Luke Nelson, a recent gruaduate from the Leeds School of Business. Here you will find snippets of my previous projects and current work. Although I studied finance and information management, I have always been interested in computers and the ability to leverage our tasks with them.

This site is a constant work in progress, so please excuse any typos or errors in it's development...
