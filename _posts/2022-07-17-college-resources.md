As I've reflected on my time in college, a few notbale moments come to mind. Here, I want to provide some of the most important and useful sheets I built to help navigate the large decisions in college. As well as, some of the organizational sheets I used to strucutre my semesters and stay on track.

Below is a discussion and some important points I want to share about early graudation, and the serious considerations that need to be taken into account when choosing to graduate early.

## Useful Sheets

[**Semester Planning**][Semester Planning] - Built to help with 3 and 4 year plans, along with class scheduling

[**Internship / Job Searching**][Job Search] - Built to help track and prioritize all internship and job applications

[**Post-Grad Financial Planning**][Financial Analysis] - Built to help forecast your first-year earnings along with some simple budgeting


## Early Graduation
I’m writing this to give some guidance and direction to those in a similar situation as I, and to help shed some light on an alternative education path into the finance industry.

### Undergrad

I just finished by Bachelor's of Science in Business Administration, emphasizing in Finance and Information Management in 2 years, 9 months, 1 day (to be exact).

Some cheat codes to your undergraduate education:
-	Take general education courses through a local community college over your summers. You can combine ~9 credits with a full-time job (yes, you’ll be busy) and graduate earlier. Transfer these into your 4-year institution, and double check with (1) [Transferology][Transferology] to ensure your community college credits transfer to your primary university, (2) your primary university academic advisor to ensure the credits will be accepted, and (3) your community college academic advisor to ensure the credits will transfer as expected.

This saves you: 
- Time
- Money
- Effort (in my experience, community college courses are significantly easier than university courses)

### Internships
Graduating in  less than 4 years while simultaneously trying to break into finance-related internships & full-time roles is quite tricky in my experience. However, it's not impossible.

A few notes...
- Large firms don’t typically recognize the unique direction you’re taking and are hesitant to hire interns with presumably less academic experience. They aren'y always wrong in this assessment of early-graduating applicants. The mis-match in college credits, and your time spent within your university does not necessarily convert to internship-ready skills and qualifications.
- Between both my first and second internship, I’ve remained at local companies. I’d further attribute this to attending a large state school with a mildly reputable business program. Which both firms were familiar and comfortable with hiring from.

#### I never had an internship between my first & second year
- I interned at a local real estate firm from my second year fall semester through summer (7 months). Followed by a stint at a local private wealth management firm from my third year fall through summer (8 months).

#### Benefits of interning locally: 
- You can end up with 14+ months of experience between two positions.
- Local firms have been extremely flexible with scheduling and remote work. They understand your priority is school and are often willing to let you choose your schedule.
- They have both paid above average hourly rates and especially understand that living as a college student isn’t very affordable (as most college towns are not).

#### Downsides of interning locally:
- Neither of these firms are household names, public companies, nor very large in employee headcount.
- I’ve had to explain each position and each firm’s line of business during nearly every interview, rather than selling myself and my skills.
- With smaller firm size comes a lack of structured intern to full-time programs. Neither firm is large enough to recruit (on a semester or annual basis) a full class or even a few interns, let alone offer them a full-time position after graduation.

Even with those disadvantages, I’ve thoroughly enjoyed interning at local firms, and highly encourage it to anyone else who doesn’t want to take on the traditional finance route.
