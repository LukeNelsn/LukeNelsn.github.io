Throughout my time at the Unversity of Colorado, and in my extra-curricular involvements, I have had the pleasure of learning and taking away valuable lessons from professors and professional mentors. I've attempted to categorize and recall the most impactful lessons, and here, I will try to develop a repository of these moments. Hopefully, more are yet to come, and this list will continue to grow.

### Professional Mentors

# Venture Capitalist Coworker & Mentor
>A healthy curiosity and ability to quickly acquire knowledge will enable you to operate very well and productively in any kind of entrepreneurial venture

# Young Adult Mentor
>Leave a lasting impact, something positive, which you can both look back on, and refer back to fondly

# Young Adult Mentor
>If it's meant to be, it's up to me. Take responsibility and own your decisions as a means to realize your potential 

### Academic Professors

# Finance Capstone Professor
>Never stop learning, life does not consist of linear, perfect decisions. There are twists and bends, so prepare yourself

# Information Management Capstone Professor
>Always strive towards and find your happiness, maintain relationships, unethical decisions or business decisions will not lead to a fulfilling life

# Financial Derivatives Professor
>Never lose sight of what's truly important. Find your "why" and your "purpose". These may take a while to determine but will assist/guide major decisions. No one will care about your academic performance in a matter of years, true meaning, value, and authenticity are what truly matter

As mentioned above, I hope to continuously add to this list. I've found that many of these points are useful to refer back to, and provide guiding principles when facing uncertainty.

Thank you for taking the time to check out this post, all built in markdown.
